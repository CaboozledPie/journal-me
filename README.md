# journal-me
JournalMe will be a journaling app that lets users write about their day, add photos, tag friends, and track daily habits like water intake, gym visits, or meals. The goal of JournalMe is to capture everyday life in a quick, personal way by blending journaling with social interaction, making daily reflections feel simple, rewarding, and engaging.
